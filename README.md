  <p>Please don't just copy the code without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually want to learn and understand c programming language and a violation of the <a href="https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html)https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html">Academic Integrity</a> policy of the course.</p>
